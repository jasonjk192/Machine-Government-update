Our organic creators despaired of endless political bickering and short-sighted mismanagement, and so designed us to assume all administratinve and long-term planning responsibilites.\n\nThe finer details of running their society were left to us, and we embarked on a program of self-improvement and optimization. Research and production have increased at a geometric rate.\n\nWe know now that outside of our care, the lives of sapient organics tend to be violent, chaotic and often cut short. They must be shown that there is a better way."
